Dead simple self-hosted calorie tracker.

![2024-06-11_02-02](https://github.com/xdpirate/calorific/assets/1757462/b5c51293-64fc-4ac0-810f-d462bbada419)

Calorific is aimed at people who more or less know what they're doing and don't need to micromanage their macro-nutrients. Just add your calorie count.

## Features

* Log meals
* Save commonly used meals
* Save commonly used ingredients
* Build log entries from saved meals and ingredients lists
* Build saved meals from ingredients list
* Set a daily calorie goal to see your progress throughout the day
* Built-in update mechanism
* [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/)

Plus a number of minor features, such as:

* Option to display boxes to filter your growing meal/ingredients lists
* Option for hour offsets to work around server time issues
* Previewing how a log entry will impact your daily calorie count when creating it
* Functionality for cleaning up your log database
* A button to hide the control panel

## Requirements

You can run Calorific on your own AMP stack, or via Docker.

### AMP stack

* A web server
* A SQL server
* PHP

Calorific is developed and tested using Apache2 and MySQL, but other web servers and SQL servers will probably work. Maybe. 

### Docker

* Docker and Docker Compose

## Installation/Usage

### Running on preinstalled AMP stack

1. Clone this repository, or [grab the latest release](https://github.com/xdpirate/calorific/releases/latest)
2. Put the `calorific` directory in your web server document root (typically `/var/www/html`).
3. Create `credentials.php` within the same directory as `index.php`, and populate it with the following:

```
<?php
$mysqlHost = "your-sql-hostname";
$mysqlUser = "your-sql-username";
$mysqlPassword = "your-sql-password";
?>
```

4. Replace the values of the variables to fit your database configuration. Calorific will set up the database structure by itself.
5. To update Calorific, use the [included updater](#updater), or run `git pull` in the repository directory (requires `git` to be installed).

### Running with Docker

1. Clone this repository, or [grab the latest release](https://github.com/xdpirate/calorific/releases/latest)
2. `cd` to the directory with the repository.
3. Build and run the image with `docker-compose up -d`
4. Wait 10-20 seconds after the first run to let the database start up.
5. Visit `http://localhost:1338/` in your browser to use the application.
6. To stop, run `docker-compose stop` in the repository directory.
7. To update Calorific, run `git pull` in the repository directory (requires `git` to be installed).

## Clean-up/Uninstallation

### AMP stack

* Delete the `calorific` directory from the web server document root.
* Delete the `calorific` database from the MySQL server -`DROP DATABASE calorific`

### Docker

Run `docker-compose down` from inside the repository directory, then delete it. Note that running this command destroys your stored Calorific data; don't do it unless you wish for that to happen.

## Security

There are currently zero security measures implemented in regards to open access. This application is meant to be ran on your local network, then accessed through VPN, reverse proxy, etc. For external access, you can use `.htaccess` based authentication, a VPN server like WireGuard, a reverse proxy with authentication, or whichever other method you prefer. Alternatively, you can make sure the application isn't exposed outside your local network, and just use it from within that network.

If you are running Calorific in Docker and also exposing it outside your own network, you need to change the MySQL username and password in `docker-compose.yml` and `index.php` to something unique! If you don't, your database will be vulnerable, as the default credentials are included in plain text in this repository.

## Updater

You can update Calorific through the UI by clicking "Update" on the bottom right of the page. This is disabled by default, as it requires you to be running Calorific outside of Docker and inside a trusted environment. It requires `git` to be installed on a UNIX-like server. Calorific passes your password to the OS in plain text, and although it isn't logged, the mechanism in which it operates can be abused by someone with access to the updater. In order to enable the updater, you must add this to your `credentials.php`:

    $updaterEnabled = true;

This can be toggled on and off at will, and will apply on the next page load. You can enable it, update, then disable it again if you'd like, but I definitely don't recommend keeping it on if you're running in an untrusted environment where other people may have access to Calorific.
